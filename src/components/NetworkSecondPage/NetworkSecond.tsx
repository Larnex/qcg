                Users <strong> do not need</strong> to trust the hubs. So even
                if you think that the provider of the hubs wants to eavesdrop on
                you, there is proof that he cannot.

                Hubs <strong>can eavesdrop</strong> on the users. This solution
                makes sense if users and hubs are parts of{" "}
                <strong>the same</strong>
                organization. This option has better key generation rates and a
                <strong>larger maximum distance.</strong> (probably between{" "}
                <strong>100-150</strong> km).

              <p className={s.text}>
                Users do not need to trust the hubs, and the hubs use{" "}
                <strong>quantum memory.</strong> This allows the users to be
                even <strong>200-250</strong> km from the hub, but the key
                generation rates are <strong>abysmal</strong> â€“ probably less
                than <strong>1Hz</strong>.

            We make it secure by using device-independent (DI) cryptography,
            which security is checked constantly in real-time and depends only
            on output statistics.
            <br />
            <br />
            It does not (as the name suggests) depend in any way on the
            implementation and therefore is secure against all
            implementation-level attacks.
            <br />
            <br />
            Therefore we will generate an entirely new level of security for
            business- critical networks, especially in Critical National
            Infrastructure sector
